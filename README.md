# Graph Visualizer

![example graph](/images/example.png)

A simple graph visualizer written in TypeScript. This uses a straightforward
physics-based simulation and attempts to produce symmetric, nice-looking
graphs.

This is only a rough test of basic concepts. It is not meant for production
use and only really works on simple, connected, reasonably sparse graphs.
